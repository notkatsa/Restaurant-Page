# Restaurant-Page

In this project I implemented an "ES6 Modules" design.  
I learned a lot of common practices like splitting a project into modules, using scripts, npm, and webpack.  
I used Vanilla JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website! Styling was done in css with the help of Webpack's css-loader.
